Project Overview 
This project investigates the vulnerability of state-of-the-art Face Recognition Systems (FRS) when subjected to Ocular Occlusion (digital goggles). By leveraging the CelebA dataset, this study benchmarks the performance of multiple deep learning architectures to determine how effectively eye-region interference can bypass biometric security.

Key Results (1,000 Identities)
The experiment was scaled to a randomized sample of 1,000 images using Google Colab's cloud infrastructure to ensure statistical significance.ModelAvg.
